1. Should have a LCD which shows the current mode of operation like a) Adhoc b) Connected 
and when everything is working fine, it shows the instantaneous power
2. Ethernet/ Zigbee should also be an option
3. Web UI should allow time to be set at the click of a button, rather tha having to do 
so manually
4. Different amperage plugs should be made available
5. Communication should not be so tighly bound as it is currently.
