We deployed a total of 33 sensors measuring the following different parameters:\r\n\r\n1. Electricity\r\n   * Household level (using Schnieder Electric EM6400 smart meter)\r\n   * MCB level (using custom microcontroller based CT platform)\r\n   * Appliance level (using jPlug, developed by Radio Studio, India)\r\n2. Water\r\n   * At inlet from utility and outlet from water tank (using Pulse based water meters)\r\n3. Ambient parameters\r\n   * Motion (using Express Controls HSM100)\r\n   * Light, temperature (using Express Controls HSM100 and FunF journal on Android phones)\r\n4. Connectivity and Network (using Android, soft sensor streams)\r\n5. Weather (using 3 weather monitoring stations providing data via REST APIs)\r\n\r\n### Repository Structure\r\n\r\nThis repository is divided as follows:\r\n\r\n* Configuration\r\n   * Database schemas: Schemas for MySQL databases used in the deployment\r\n   * Misc: Miscellaneous mappings between sensor id and locaiton in home\r\n* Dataset\r\n   * Annotated dataset: Contains *fully* labeled dataset from our deployment\r\n   * Metadata: Contains pertinent metadata for different appliances in the home and different water fixtures\r\n* How To: Misc. how to guides which are not specific to the deployment, but used in our case\r\n* Software:\r\n   * Common: Software common to SBCs and Server\r\n   * Sensors_SBC: Software used by different sensors/SBCs to get data from sensors\r\n   * Server: Software used for server management\r\n   * Startup scripts: Various startup scripts used for uninterrupted data collection (even after power outage)\r\n   * Installation: How to prepare the various computational systems for deployment\r\n   * Stats: Scripts and their outputs used for the plots used in the paper\r\n* Deployment notes\r\n\r\nOne can also find the various issues and how we resolved them.\r\n\r\n1.

The detailed metadata dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/nipunreddevil/Home_Deployment/wiki/Appliance-Metadata).\r\n2. The UTC timestamped annotated dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/nipunreddevil/Home_Deployment/tree/master/dataset). The event sequence for the same and more information about the same can be found on the same page.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
