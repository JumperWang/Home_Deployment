{"name":"Home deployment","tagline":"","body":"### Deployment Overview\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75845627/Deployment/overall_deployment.jpg \"Deployment in Home I\")\r\n\r\nThe figure above shows the overall deployment across a 3 storey home in Delhi, India. We deployed a total of 33 sensors measuring the following different parameters:\r\n\r\n1. Electricity\r\n   * Household level (using Schnieder Electric EM6400 smart meter)\r\n   * MCB level (using custom microcontroller based CT platform)\r\n   * Appliance level (using jPlug, developed by Radio Studio, India)\r\n2. Water\r\n   * At inlet from utility and outlet from water tank (using Pulse based water meters)\r\n3. Ambient parameters\r\n   * Motion (using Express Controls HSM100)\r\n   * Light, temperature (using Express Controls HSM100 and FunF journal on Android phones)\r\n4. Connectivity and Network (using Android, soft sensor streams)\r\n5. Weather (using 3 weather monitoring stations providing data via REST APIs)\r\n\r\n### Repository Structure\r\n\r\nThis repository is divided as follows:\r\n\r\n* Configuration\r\n   * Database schemas: Schemas for MySQL databases used in the deployment\r\n   * Misc: Miscellaneous mappings between sensor id and locaiton in home\r\n* Dataset\r\n   * Annotated dataset: Contains *fully* labeled dataset from our deployment\r\n   * Metadata: Contains pertinent metadata\r\n\r\nFor each of these you may find more details in the respective Readme files\r\nin corresponding folders.\r\n\r\nThe following is the port assignment to different services\r\n\r\n* 80 - Data from JPlug is written using PhP script to files in /var/www\r\n* 9000- To manually go and check the last 10 readings of individual JPlugs\r\n* 9001- Data from smart meter is upload (CSV's) and can be visualized\r\n* 9002- Data from CT's is uploaded and can be visualized\r\n* 9003- Data from water meter is uploaded (pulses) and can be seen\r\n* 9004- Data from Multisensors is uploaded and can be visualized\r\n* 9009- Memory, CPU, Disk Memory, Client Time\r\n* 9010- An application is run which tells about the status of different deployments done above\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
