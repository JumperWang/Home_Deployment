To reduce interfence, we configure Plug Computer not to broadcast it's SSID.
This can be done by configuring it in Wi-Fi client mode. This can be done by 
the following procedure:

1. Run /root/setup/init_wlan
This should give an output like the following
Stopping very small Busybox based DHCP server: Stopped /usr/sbin/udhcpd (pid 1322).
udhcpd.
Stopping DNS forwarder and DHCP server: dnsmasq.
Starting DNS forwarder and DHCP server: dnsmasq.

2. Now we would add this to startup process so that it does not on bootup
come up in AP mode
Change the last line in /root/setup/run_setup to init_wlan from init_uap
