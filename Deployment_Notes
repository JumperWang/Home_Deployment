1. Router seems to have gone crazy. Not giving proper names to different hardware.
-Added as an issue currently.
2. Tested from hostel room if data is getting collected on the server. Unfortunately, 
for both smart meter and jPlug there was no data since a long time. RPi which was 
attached to the Smart Meter had lose Power, whereas jPlug is unresolved. 
-Need to buy Belkin extension cables asap.
+Providing SSH access was helpful in finding which system is working,
else coming to the lab and testing might have resulted in more data loss

1. It was observed that monitoring process (which sends emails) was getting killed.
The reason behind the same is that internet was down and that exception was not handled.
This makes a stronger case of also using SMS based notifications and alerts in order
to be independent of frequent internet losses. Also, exception handling was added.
